One solution is to avoid mixing percentages and fixed units within the same `calc()` expression.  Instead, consider using JavaScript to dynamically calculate the width or use CSS variables to define intermediate values. For example, you could set a CSS variable to represent the 10px offset and then use that variable in your `calc()` expression. Alternatively, you can ensure the parent element's dimensions are resolved before using the `calc()` expression, perhaps by using flexbox or grid layout.
