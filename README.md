This repository demonstrates a common issue with the CSS `calc()` function.  When using percentages and fixed units together, unexpected results can occur due to calculation order and context dependency. The `bug.css` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` offers a possible solution.  This issue is more prevalent in scenarios where element widths are dynamically determined or depend on parent element dimensions. The solution explores alternative approaches to achieve the intended layout.
